##The extraction idea:

###Original Aim:
To try my hand at parsing a simple HTML page, and finally extracting desired information displayed after giving certain inputs to the page.

###Finally:
Due to the specific website I was targeting, I needed to simulate key entries and submit button clicks so I used Selenium which didn't work quite well with Firefox, but Chrome(with Chromedriver) worked like charm!

####Complete File:
Refer to 'result-extractor.py' for complete code.
It requires Selenium, BeautifulSoup and a few ither libraries/dependencies installed.
The output file is 'results.csv', not uploaded here.

###Thank you!
